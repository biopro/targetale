model	... Model type (TALgetter is the default model that uses individual binding specificities for each RVD. TALgetter13 uses binding specificities that only depend on amino acid 13, i.e., the second amino acid of the repat.While TALgetter is recommended in most cases, the use of TALgetter13 may be beneficial if you search for target sites of TAL effector with many rare RVDs, for instance YG, HH, or S*., range={TALgetter, TALgetter13}, default = TALgetter)	= TALgetter
pval	... PVals (Computation of p-Values, range={NONE, COARSE, FINE}, default = COARSE)	= COARSE

top	... Maximum number of target sites (Limits the total number of reported target sites in all input sequences, ranked by their score., valid range = [1, 10000], default = 100)	= 10000
train	... Training data (The input data to use for training the model, annotated FastA, OPTIONAL)	= null
strand	... Both strands (Search both strands of the input sequence for target sites, default = false)	= false
