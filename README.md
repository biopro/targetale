# TargeTALE
A web tool to map TALE genes in the genome X. oryzae strains and their potential targets in *O. sativa*


## The pipeline

TargeTALE is an web pipeline that predicts Transcription Activator-like Effectors (TALEs) in the genome of Xanthomonas oryzae strains and the genes that they target in the genome of different model and non-model organisms, such as rice (O. sativa). The TALE prediction is performed using AnnoTALE and the hits are compared to a set of promoters derived from Osiris using TALgetter. Finally, the biological processes affected by each TALE are identified using the Uniprot-GOA API.

## Availability

The tool is freely availably through our webserver http://bioprolab.ufpel.edu.br/targeTALE/.
